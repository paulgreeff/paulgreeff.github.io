## Hi, I'm Paul

### About me
I've been involved in software developent and operations for the last 15 years.

### A brief history of Paul

#### Academic background
I studied Electronic Engineering and completed my postgraduate studies specialising in Telecommunications and Cryptography.
During my postgraduate studies I started lecturing in the engineering department, electronic and computer engineering, as well as the computer science department. 

The subject matter was diverse and include in no particular order
- Software engineering (postgraduate and undergraduate)
- VHDL programming
- Digital systems
- Computer architecture and microcontrollers
- Engineering graphics
- And courses presented to industry - Telecommunications fundamentals.

At the time I joined I was the youngest lecturer in the department until a gifted fellow student dethroned me.

#### Work experience
Six years later, a little bit of boredom and an exciting offer, afforded me an opportunity to defect to private industry.

Responsibilities started out initially with programming in PHP, bash and Postgres SQL and later transitioned more to presales, marketing, operations and client support. 

Later I was involved in most of the organisations functioning, sales, marketing, tender applications, software development and all client support and of course, operations, responsible for cloud and bare metal infrastructure.

My official title was Chief of Operations or operations manager but I prefer the title chief propellerhead.

As the lead engineer I was responsible for software development in Python, RouterOS scripting, PHP, Bash, C and C++ (maintaining old systems, no new development here), Google Bigquery, Postgresql and SQLite with most of our systems maintained on GCP with a few bare metal servers.

#### Current
This chapter closes after 15 years with me exploring new avenues, currently in the form of consulting.
