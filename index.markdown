## About this site
I don't like saying 'This site is still under construction' as that has become a bit of a cliche, however, I will say it is still being populated. I've just recently decided to work on this site, and depending on its utility may or may not keep it around.

For the moment it hosts a number of useful links in the resources section and a small page about me. I am planning on moving my Google site, [http://www.paulgreeff.com](www.paulgreeff.com) and associated bio over to Github pages as I don't really use the Google site much. I commit daily to private projects on Github so it makes more sense to host it here.
